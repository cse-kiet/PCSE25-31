# REECLE:To Develop Revolutionizing waste management system by using Sustainiable Practices
# Problem Statement :
This study examines the idea of comprehensive waste management and argues in favor of a multifaceted strategy to maximize garbage collection routes in urban areas. Conventional trash management frequently overlooks the larger environmental and social ramifications in favor of efficiency. In addition to distance, this research suggests a methodology that takes into account bin fullness levels, real-time traffic data, and energy expenditure during collection. The framework seeks to create a more responsible and sustainable waste management system by incorporating these characteristics. This multi-dimensional technique is used in a unique route optimization project that is presented in the study along with an analysis of its potential to lower environmental impact and encourage environmental stewardship.
