# Wastify-CodeJOD-Dotslash

<h2>Wastify-The urban waste management system</h2>

Wastify is an android app based project for waste management system in the urban cities.It is developed by Team CodeJOD.

The app "Wastify" is divided into three portals 'Super-Admin',  'Citizen',  'Driver'. The 'Citizen' portal is for normal user of the app. The 'Super-Admin' portal is for the monitoring-authority .The 'Driver' is for the Driver of the Garbage Collection van.


<h2>Functionalities</h2>
<p> In the citizen portal the features included are Dustbin location, Garbage van collection time, Filing any complains related to Waste Management of city. The citizens are provided with wet and dry dustbin locations of the city.</p>

<p>In the Driver portal the main feature is the startDuty, in the startDuty feature of app the Driver has to upload the images of thier garbage collection at every stop he has been assinged as a part of this duty, along with the image the location details is shared to the Database with Time and Date. With the Duty submission feature the Driver portal has the feature to apply for leave.</p>

<p>In the Super-Admin portal the Admin has the access to features like Monitoring Drivers, Citizen Complains, Driver Leave application. In the Driver Monitoring the admin has access to monitor the driver location along with time and date. Also the admin can view CitizenComplains,DriverLeaveApplications and try to solve Citizen Complains and approve/reject the Driver Leave Application on thier own his/her own credit.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <p>1. Java</p>
      <p>2. XML, Firebase</p>
      <p>3. Android Studio</p>
      <p>4. Google Map SDK</p>
  
<h2>Other information related to the app</h2>
      <p>The dustbin locations used are dummy locations, selected randomly, a RFID tags on dustbin will be required to change the dummy location with realtime locations </p>
      <p>The citizen-user are provided with certain set of articles to educate them with topics related to waste classification,waste management, waste disposal </p>
      <p>The driver location along with timestamp is stored in Database and this can be accesssed by the Super-admin</p>
      <p>The Super-admin has access to assing 'admin' and 'driver' roles to the user</p>

# REECLE:To Develop Revolutionizing waste management system by using Sustainiable Practices
# Problem Statement :
Urban areas face significant challenges in waste management, with conventional systems often prioritizing efficiency over the broader environmental and social implications. These systems typically fail to account for factors such as bin fullness levels, real-time traffic conditions, and energy consumption, leading to inefficiencies and increased environmental impact.

# Solution :
This project aims to address these gaps by proposing a comprehensive waste management solution **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** that optimizes garbage collection routes using a multifaceted approach. By integrating factors like bin capacity, live traffic data, and energy usage, the framework seeks to develop a more sustainable and responsible system. The solution not only reduces environmental impact but also promotes environmental stewardship through innovative route optimization techniques.

# Reserach Paper Link :
Our research paper, **accepted at IST'24** (Innovations in Science & Technology 2024) by NIT Srinagar, explores innovative approaches to sustainable waste management. You can access the paper through the link below:
