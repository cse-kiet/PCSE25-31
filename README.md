# REECLE:To Develop Revolutionizing waste management system by using Sustainiable Practices
# Problem Statement :
Urban areas face significant challenges in waste management, with conventional systems often prioritizing efficiency over the broader environmental and social implications. These systems typically fail to account for factors such as bin fullness levels, real-time traffic conditions, and energy consumption, leading to inefficiencies and increased environmental impact.

# Solution :
This project aims to address these gaps by proposing a comprehensive waste management solution Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) that optimizes garbage collection routes using a multifaceted approach. By integrating factors like bin capacity, live traffic data, and energy usage, the framework seeks to develop a more sustainable and responsible system. The solution not only reduces environmental impact but also promotes environmental stewardship through innovative route optimization techniques.
